;;; Commentary:
;;
;; I'm not satisfied with buffer navigation in Emacs.
;;
;; - The `next-buffer` and `previous-buffer` functions walk across all
;; the buffers, including private junk buffers and unimportant
;; buffers.  And I'm never sure if I should go back or forth to find
;; the buffer I want.
;;
;; - In order to be efficient, `switch-to-buffer` and cousins require
;; knowing the name of the target buffer prior to switching to it.
;; Sometimes I have to pause and think...  and if I don't know where I
;; want to go, I'm forced to visually seek among a bunch of
;; unimportant buffers.  The same goes to similar functions such as
;; recentf functions, etc.
;;
;; The buffer-trail solution is to maintain a list of buffers to be
;; updated when you explicitly switch to other buffers.  But there's a
;; catch: you have to manually tell what functions update the trail,
;; for example:
;;
;;     (buffer-trail-advise '(helm-buffers-list
;;                            helm-find-files
;;                            helm-recentf
;;                            helm-projectile-find-file))
;;
;; This selectivity comes in handy when I'm doing a project search, as
;; I don't want to include most results in the trail.  On the other
;; hand, if I'm explicitly switching to a buffer, most certaily I'll
;; want to keep track of it.
;;
;; Also note that you need to explicitly map a few functions:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s-.") 'buffer-trail-forward)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s-,") 'buffer-trail-backward)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s-/") 'buffer-trail-show-breadcrumbs)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s-a") 'buffer-trail-add)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s-=") 'buffer-trail-forward)
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "s--") 'buffer-trail-backward)
;;
;; Note that when walking to the next or previous buffers, the current
;; buffer is included in the trail if it isn't already.
